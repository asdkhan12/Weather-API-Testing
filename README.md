# Weather-API-Testing
This project fetches current weather data for a set of major world cities using the OpenWeatherMap API, stores the results in a local SQLite database, and then uses pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize temperature and wind patterns. It highlights the cities with the highest and lowest temperatures, examines wind-speed trends.
